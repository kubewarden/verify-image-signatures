  io.kubewarden.policy.description: A Kubewarden Policy that verifies all the signatures of the container images referenced by a Pod

  io.kubewarden.policy.usage: |
    This policy validates Sigstore signatures for containers, init container and ephemeral container that match the name provided
    in the `image` settings field. It will reject the Pod if any validation fails.
    If all signature validation pass or there is no container that matches the image name, the Pod will be accepted.
    
    This policy also mutates matching images to add the image digest, therefore the version of the deployed image can't change.
    This mutation can be disabled by setting `modifyImagesWithDigest` to `false`.
    
    There are four types of signatures: GitHub actions, public key, keyless exact match and keyless prefix.
