  io.kubewarden.policy.description: A Kubewarden Policy that verifies all the signatures of the container images referenced by a Pod

  io.kubewarden.policy.usage: |
    This policy validates Sigstore signatures for containers, init container and ephemeral container that match the name provided
    in the `image` settings field. It will reject the Pod if any validation fails.
    If all signature validation pass or there is no container that matches the image name, the Pod will be accepted.
    
    This policy also mutates matching images to add the image digest, therefore the version of the deployed image can't change.
    This mutation can be disabled by setting `modifyImagesWithDigest` to `false`.
    
    See the [Secure Supply Chain docs in Kubewarden](https://docs.kubewarden.io/distributing-policies/secure-supply-chain) for more info.
  
    ## Settings
  
    The policy takes a list of signatures. A signature can be of four types: GitHub actions, public key, keyless exact match or keyless prefix. Each signature
    has an `image` field which will be used to select the matching containers in the pod that will be evaluated.
    `image` supports wildcard. For example, `ghcr.io/kubewarden/*` will match all images from the kubewarden ghcr repo.
  
    Signature types:
  
    1. GitHub actions. It will verify that all images were signed for a GitHub action with the `kubewarden` owner and in the repo `app-example`
    
    ``` yaml
    signatures:
      - image: "ghcr.io/kubewarden/*"
        owner: "kubewarden" #optional
        repo: "app-example"
    ```
    
    2. Keyless subject prefix. It will verify that the issuer is `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` and the subject starts with `https://github.com/kubewarden/app-example/.github/workflows/ci.yml@refs/tags/`
    `url_prefix` is sanitized to prevent typosquatting.
    
    ``` yaml
    signatures:
      - image: "ghcr.io/kubewarden/*"
        keyless_prefix:
          - issuer: "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
            url_prefix: "https://github.com/kubewarden/app-example/.github/workflows/ci.yml@refs/tags/"
    ```
    
    3. Keyless exact match. It will verify that the issuer is `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` and the subject is `kubewarden`. It will not modify the image with the digest.
    
    ``` yaml
    modifyImagesWithDigest: false #optional. default is true
    signatures:
      - image: "ghcr.io/kubewarden/*"
        keyless:
          - issuer: "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
            subject: "kubewarden"
    ```
  
    4. Public key. It will verify that all images were signed with the two public keys provided and contains the `env: prod` annotation
      
      ``` yaml
      signatures:
        - image: "ghcr.io/kubewarden/*"
          pubKeys:
            - "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----xxxxx-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
            - "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----xxxxx-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
          annotations: #optional
            env: prod
      ```
