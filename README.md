# Kubewarden policy verify-image-signatures

## Description

This policy will reject pods that have a name `invalid-pod-name`. If
the pod to be validated has a different name, or if a different type
of resource is evaluated, it will be accepted.

## Settings

This policy has no configurable settings. This would be a good place
to document if yours does, and what behaviors can be configured by
tweaking them.
